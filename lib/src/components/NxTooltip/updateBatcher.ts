 * MAX_WORK_TIME ms since the first one was submitted, and then executes them all in requestIdleTimeout. The
 * batched units of work are executed within React's unstable_batchedUpdates in order to signficantly cut down
 * on React overhead.  Note that adjusting BATCH_SIZE involves a tradeoff between minimizing react overhead
 * by using large batches, and keeping the page reasonably interactive. The current BATCH_SIZE is tuned to the
 * workloads and needs of NxTooltip (and NxOverflowTooltip) specifically.
